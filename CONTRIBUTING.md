## Making changes
Depending on your changes there are certain rules you have to follow if you expect
your Pull Request to be merged.

**Note**: It is recommended to create a new remote branch for each Pull Request. 
Based on the current `development` changes!

1. Adding a new Method or Class
- Keep your code consistent!
  - Compare your code style to the one used all over LiFeBot.js to ensure you do not break the consistency
  (if you find issues in the existing style you can include and update it)
  
2. Making a Commit
    - While having multiple commits can help the reader understand your changes, it might sometimes be
      better to include more changes in a single commit.
    - When you commit your changes write a proper commit caption which explains what you have done
    
3. Updating your Fork
    - Before you start committing make sure your fork is updated.
